### State Management
The landing page uses React state to control the user experience:

```typescript
const [showTaskInput, setShowTaskInput] = useState(false)

const handleGetStarted = () => {
  setShowTaskInput(true)
  // Smooth scroll to task input
  setTimeout(() => {
    taskInputRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ 
      behavior: 'smooth', 
      block: 'center' 
    })
  }, 100)
}
```
