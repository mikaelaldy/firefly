```

## Key Metrics

### Focus Time Tracking
- **Total Focus Time**: Sum of all session durations (including partial sessions - every minute of focus counts!)
- **Average Session Length**: Mean duration of all sessions with recorded time
- **Sessions This Week**: Count of sessions started since the beginning of the current week

### Completion Analytics
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of started sessions that were completed (based on completion flag)
- **Variance Tracking**: Difference between planned and actual session duration

### ADHD-Friendly Approach
The system counts **all focus time**, not just completed sessions. This design choice recognizes that:
- Partial sessions still represent valuable focus time
- ADHD brains benefit from celebrating all effort, not just "perfect" sessions
- Every minute of focused work contributes to building better habits
- Completion rate is tracked separately to maintain goal awareness without penalizing partial progress

### Personal Records
- **Longest Session**: Maximum duration of any session with recorded time
- **Best Week**: Highest total focus time in any single week (includes all sessions)
- **Current Streak**: Consecutive days with at least one session (any session counts!)
- **Longest Streak**: Maximum consecutive days achieved historically

## Streak Calculation

The streak system encourages daily focus habits:

### Current Streak
- Calculated by counting consecutive days backwards from today
- Counts days with at least one session (completion not required - showing up matters!)
- Resets to 0 if there's a gap in daily activity

### Longest Streak
- Tracks the maximum consecutive days ever achieved
- Calculated by analyzing all historical session data
- Provides long-term motivation and achievement tracking

## Insights System

The dashboard generates contextual insights based on user behavior:

### Celebration Messages
Triggered when users achieve significant milestones:
- Streaks of 3+ days
- Total focus time exceeding 2 hours
- Completion rates of 80% or higher

### Encouragement Messages
Supportive messages for users who need motivation:
- No sessions this week
- Fewer than 3 sessions this week
- General encouragement when no specific triggers apply

### Tips and Recommendations
ADHD-specific advice based on usage patterns:
- Pomodoro technique suggestions for short average sessions
- Confidence-building tips for low completion rates
- Personalized recommendations based on individual patterns
