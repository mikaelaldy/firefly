# Dashboard & Analytics System

The Firefly ADHD Focus App includes a comprehensive dashboard system designed to provide users with meaningful insights into their focus patterns while maintaining ADHD-friendly design principles.

## Overview

The dashboard serves as a central hub for users to:
- Track their focus progress over time
- Celebrate achievements and milestones
- Identify patterns in their focus sessions
- Get encouraging, ADHD-specific insights
- Quickly start new focus sessions

## API Endpoint

### GET /api/dashboard/stats

Returns comprehensive analytics for the authenticated user.

**Authentication**: Required (Bearer token or session cookie)

**Response Structure**:
```typescript
interface DashboardStatsResponse {
  totalFocusTime: number; // in minutes
  averageSessionLength: number; // in minutes
  completionRate: number; // percentage
  sessionsThisWeek: number;
  personalRecords: {
    longestSession: number; // in minutes
    bestWeek: number; // total minutes
    currentStreak: number; // days
    longestStreak: number; // days
  };
  recentSessions: Array<{
    id: string;
    goal: string;
    plannedDuration: number; // seconds
    actualDuration: number; // seconds
    completed: boolean;
    variance: number; // percentage
    startedAt: string;
    completedAt?: string;
  }>;
  insights: Array<{
    message: string;
    type: 'celebration' | 'encouragement' | 'tip';
  }>;
}
```

## Key Metrics

### Focus Time Tracking
- **Total Focus Time**: Sum of all session durations (including partial sessions - every minute of focus counts!)
- **Average Session Length**: Mean duration of all sessions with recorded time
- **Sessions This Week**: Count of sessions started since the beginning of the current week

### Completion Analytics
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of started sessions that were completed (based on completion flag)
- **Variance Tracking**: Difference between planned and actual session duration

### ADHD-Friendly Approach
The system counts **all focus time**, not just completed sessions. This design choice recognizes that:
- Partial sessions still represent valuable focus time
- ADHD brains benefit from celebrating all effort, not just "perfect" sessions
- Every minute of focused work contributes to building better habits
- Completion rate is tracked separately to maintain goal awareness without penalizing partial progress

### Personal Records
- **Longest Session**: Maximum duration of any session with recorded time
- **Best Week**: Highest total focus time in any single week (includes all sessions)
- **Current Streak**: Consecutive days with at least one session (any session counts!)
- **Longest Streak**: Maximum consecutive days achieved historically

## Streak Calculation

The streak system encourages daily focus habits:

### Current Streak
- Calculated by counting consecutive days backwards from today
- Counts days with at least one session (completion not required - showing up matters!)
- Resets to 0 if there's a gap in daily activity

### Longest Streak
- Tracks the maximum consecutive days ever achieved
- Calculated by analyzing all historical session data
- Provides long-term motivation and achievement tracking

## Insights System

The dashboard generates contextual insights based on user behavior:

### Celebration Messages
Triggered when users achieve significant milestones:
- Streaks of 3+ days
- Total focus time exceeding 2 hours
- Completion rates of 80% or higher

### Encouragement Messages
Supportive messages for users who need motivation:
- No sessions this week
- Fewer than 3 sessions this week
- General encouragement when no specific triggers apply

### Tips and Recommendations
ADHD-specific advice based on usage patterns:
- Pomodoro technique suggestions for short average sessions
- Confidence-building tips for low completion rates
- Personalized recommendations based on individual patterns

## Component Architecture

### Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)
- **Authentication Guard**: Redirects unauthenticated users to login
- **Loading States**: Skeleton components while data loads
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures

### Layout Components

#### DashboardSidebar (Available but not yet integrated)
A specialized sidebar component designed for dashboard navigation:
- **Quick Actions**: Prominent buttons for starting focus and action sessions
- **Section Navigation**: Smooth scrolling navigation to dashboard sections
- **Settings Access**: Direct link to user settings
- **Active State Management**: Visual indicators for current section
- **Responsive Design**: Collapsible on mobile devices

**Current Status**: Component is implemented but not yet integrated into the dashboard page. The dashboard currently uses a generic `Sidebar` layout component.

**Integration Opportunity**: Replace the current generic sidebar with `DashboardSidebar` for enhanced navigation and user experience.

### Core Components

#### DashboardStats
Displays key metrics in an easy-to-scan format:
- Weekly focus time with visual progress indicators
- Completion rate with encouraging context
- Session count with streak information

#### SessionHistory
Shows recent session data:
- Last 10 sessions with goal, duration, and completion status
- Variance indicators (positive/negative)
- Quick access to session details

#### PersonalRecords
Highlights achievements:
- Longest session with celebration context
- Best week performance
- Current and longest streaks with visual indicators

#### ProgressInsights
Contextual messaging system:
- Rotates through relevant insights
- ADHD-friendly positive reinforcement
- Actionable tips and encouragement

#### QuickStart

- Focuses on personal growth over absolute metrics

### Cognitive Load Reduction
- Clean, uncluttered interface
- Essential information prominently displayed
- Progressive disclosure of detailed data

### Motivation Maintenance
- Streak tracking for habit building
- Achievement highlighting
- Encouraging language throughout

### Accessibility Features

## Testing Considerations

### Manual QA Checklist
1. **Authentication**: Verify dashboard requires login
2. **Data Accuracy**: Confirm metrics match actual session data
3. **Streak Calculation**: Test consecutive day counting
4. **Insights Generation**: Verify appropriate messages appear
5. **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile and desktop
6. **Loading States**: Confirm skeleton components work
7. **Error States**: Test with network failures

### Unit Testing
- Streak calculation algorithms
- Variance computation
- Insight generation logic
- Date range calculations

## Recent Updates

### Focus Time Calculation Enhancement
**Updated**: Focus time tracking now includes all sessions with recorded duration, not just completed ones.

**Rationale**: This change better supports ADHD users by:
- Recognizing that partial focus sessions still have value
- Reducing shame around "incomplete" sessions
- Encouraging users to start sessions without fear of "failure"
- Providing more accurate representation of actual focus effort

**Technical Changes**:
- `totalFocusTime`: Now sums all sessions with `actual_duration > 0`
- `averageSessionLength`: Calculated from all sessions with duration data
- `personalRecords.bestWeek`: Includes all sessions with duration
- Completion rate remains separate to track goal achievement

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Components
- âœ… Dashboard analytics API endpoint (`/api/dashboard/stats`)
- âœ… Core dashboard components (Stats, History, Records, Insights)
- âœ… Authentication integration with proper error handling
- âœ… ADHD-friendly design principles implementation
- âœ… Responsive layout with mobile support

### Available but Not Integrated
- ðŸ”„ **DashboardSidebar Component**: Fully implemented navigation sidebar with:
  - Quick action buttons for starting sessions
  - Section navigation with smooth scrolling
  - Settings access and active state management
  - Ready for integration to replace generic sidebar

### Integration Recommendations
1. **Replace Generic Sidebar**: Update `app/dashboard/page.tsx` to use `DashboardSidebar` instead of the generic `Sidebar` component
2. **Enhanced Navigation**: The specialized sidebar provides better UX with dedicated dashboard navigation
3. **Consistent Design**: Maintains the same visual design language as other dashboard components

## Future Enhancements

- Add keyboard shortcuts for quick actions
- Implement section-specific loading states

### Potential Features
- Weekly/monthly trend charts
- Goal-specific analytics
