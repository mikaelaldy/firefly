# Documentation Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Enhanced Timer Controls Documentation

**File**: `docs/enhanced-timer-controls.md`

**Changes**:
- Updated Action Navigation Controls section to reflect that Previous/Next buttons are now integrated into the main TimerControls component rather than being separate inline controls
- Updated TimerControlsProps interface documentation to include new navigation-related props:
  - `onPrevious?: () => void`
  - `onNext?: () => void` 
  - `showNavigation?: boolean`
  - `canGoPrevious?: boolean`
  - `canGoNext?: boolean`
- Updated component usage examples to show proper integration of navigation controls
- Clarified visual design details for navigation buttons (circular, smaller size, positioned on sides)

### 2. Updated Main README

**File**: `README.md`

**Changes**:
- Updated feature description from "navigate between actions" to "integrated action navigation" 
- Updated demo steps to mention "integrated timer controls" and "integrated Previous/Next buttons"
- Clarified that navigation controls are part of the main timer interface rather than separate

### 3. Code Cleanup

**File**: `components/timer/ActionTimer.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed unused `handleTimerComplete` function that was declared but never used
- Cleaned up unused `updatedAction` variable and simplified extension tracking comment
- Fixed TypeScript warnings about unused variables

## Summary

The main change reflected in this documentation update is the consolidation of action navigation controls into the main TimerControls component. Previously, there were separate inline navigation controls rendered directly in the ActionTimer component. These have been removed in favor of integrated Previous/Next buttons within the TimerControls component itself.

This change:
- Improves visual consistency by keeping all timer controls in one unified interface
- Reduces code duplication and complexity
- Maintains all existing functionality while providing a cleaner UI
- Preserves keyboard shortcuts and confirmation modals for navigation

The documentation now accurately reflects this architectural change and provides updated examples for developers implementing the enhanced timer controls.

## Impact

- **User Experience**: No functional changes - all navigation features remain available
- **Developer Experience**: Cleaner API with navigation controls integrated into main TimerControls component
- **Code Maintenance**: Reduced complexity with consolidated control interface
