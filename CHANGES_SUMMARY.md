# Timer Architecture Refactoring - Changes Summary

## What Changed

### 1. Timer Component Refactoring
- **Fixed corrupted Timer.tsx**: Restored proper syntax and functionality
- **Implemented dual-component architecture**: Timer now routes between RegularTimer and ActionTimer
- **Separated concerns**: RegularTimer handles basic functionality, ActionTimer handles action-based sessions
- **Maintained backward compatibility**: All existing Timer usage continues to work unchanged

### 2. Code Quality Improvements
- **Fixed React hooks issues**: Separated components to avoid conditional hook calls
- **Improved maintainability**: Clear separation between basic and enhanced timer features
- **Enhanced type safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces throughout
- **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned up SessionResults.tsx

### 3. Documentation Updates

#### New Documentation
- **`docs/timer-architecture.md`**: Comprehensive technical documentation of the timer system
  - Component architecture explanation
  - Design decisions and rationale
  - Usage patterns and examples
  - Error handling and performance considerations
  - Testing strategy and future enhancements

#### Updated Documentation
- **`README.md`**: Added timer architecture section with reference to detailed docs
- **`docs/testing-guide.md`**: Added timer component routing tests
- **`docs/manual-qa-checklist.md`**: Added component switching verification steps

## Technical Benefits

### 1. Code Organization
- **Single Responsibility**: Each timer component has a clear, focused purpose
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic timer works independently, actions enhance the experience
- **Maintainable**: Changes to action features don't affect basic timer functionality

### 2. Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: ActionTimer only loads when needed
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Regular timer users don't load action-related code
- **Efficient Updates**: Optimized update intervals for different use cases

### 3. Developer Experience
- **Clear Architecture**: Easy to understand component relationships
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Testing**: Separated concerns make unit testing more straightforward

## User Impact

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing functionality preserved
- Same props interface for Timer component
- Consistent session data format
- Identical navigation patterns

### Enhanced Functionality
- Better separation between basic and advanced features
- More reliable timer operation
- Improved code stability and maintainability

## Files Modified

### Core Components
- `components/timer/Timer.tsx` - Fixed and refactored with dual-component architecture
- `components/SessionResults.tsx` - Removed unused import

### Documentation
- `docs/timer-architecture.md` - New comprehensive technical documentation
- `README.md` - Added timer architecture section
- `docs/testing-guide.md` - Updated with component routing tests
- `docs/manual-qa-checklist.md` - Added component switching verification

## Commit Message Suggestion

```
