# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the dashboard layout, navigation, and user experience for the Firefly ADHD Focus App. The current dashboard has layout and padding issues, lacks proper navigation structure, and could benefit from being organized into multiple focused pages. This improvement will create a more intuitive and organized dashboard experience that better serves users managing their focus sessions and progress tracking.

4. WHEN I interact with dashboard elements THEN the system SHALL ensure adequate spacing between interactive components for easy clicking/tapping

5. IF I have pending or active sessions THEN the system SHALL display relevant status indicators in the navigation

### Requirement 6
